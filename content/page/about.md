Hello, I am a Yiou Chen. I am currently a Computer Science student at Stony Brook University (graduating soon). I do front-end development and game development. I also like to draw.  
I will try to force myself to post once in a while. I will mainly write about what I learn from my daily work as a front end developer. However, as I am graduating soon, I don't know how my schedule will be after I leave school.  
If you don't see me update for a while, have a look at my [personal website](http://yiou.me)
