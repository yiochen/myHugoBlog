I have done a couple technical interviews, both onsite and online. In my spare time, I also did some mock interviews for friends. I am a recent grad as well. Not long ago, I was also going through the grill of interviews. Having sat at both sides of the table, I found that interviewing others isn't an easy task either.

## If a interviewee is smart, s/he is likely to get a harder question
From my first impression of the candidate, through resume or website, I have a basic sense of the technical background of the candidate. This is inaccurate sometimes. If I feel the candidate doesn't have a very long history of programming, I will probably ask a simple question first to see if s/he can actually code. Base on the performance on first question, I will decide the difficulty of second question. If the candidate has been programming for a while, I will start out with a hard question.
