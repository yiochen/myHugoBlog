> I am writing this post to sort out some thoughts I have recently. Also a tribute to all my fellow job seekers. I know this process is stressful. We are all on the same boat.

So I grew up, 20ish age, pair of glasses gives me some geeky look. I dress up in business casual, with shirt and cardigan, dark navy jeans. 2 months before graduation, I am about to kick my text books into storage, and start my career as a professional coder.

This is me, an incoming college graduate in Computer Science major, with Digital Art minor. As most of the people who were lucky to choose this lucrative career path early as a college student, looking forward to making some six figure salary in silican valley, my future seems very bright. I know I will get a dream job eventually. I am very confident about that. I keeps telling myself this. But I also have to admit that, I am not the smartest person. I have strength, and also weakness. I was planning on writing about my job seeking experience after I finally land a job. But I think at that time, I will be overwhelmed by the happiness, and everything I went through would be glorified. So I deceided to start writing it now. At my hardest, most stressful period.

I have found that, college and industry are very different. I learned from one of my sociology class, the functions of college: 1. to pair young people up. 2. to delay the time they enter society. At the last year of my college, I started to realize the gap between what I learned in college and what the industry requires. Colleges teach us theory, and small excercise with simple projects that only requires successful compilation. But that's totally not enough. We need a lot of practice, to improve our coding style, to speed up our coding speed, to train our algorithmic thinking and to learn a whole tons of technologies not taught in college.

I feel I didn't waste my four years (although some might say that they are a total waste). At the end of my high school, I told myself: OK, these are the two things I want to do for life, art and programming. I was well aware of the hardship people had when graduating from art school and facing the job market. So I chose Computer Science. I maintained a fairly high GPA, 3.87 out of 4.0 in college. I also managed to aquire one internship every summer, starting from the summer when I graduated from high school. My internships are from different fields, advertising, finance, health care. Only at the last summer, I started a internship as a software developer.

As the begining of my final year, two semesters before graduation, some of my friends in the same field were already started searching for jobs. One of my friend urged me to look for jobs. At that time, I was working part-time in the same company I worked during summer. This job is not permanent (no job is permanent), our contract will end when I graduate from college. I didn't felt very pressured.

I thought I still had time to apply for jobs in the last semester. I stumbled upon Google's career site, and thought, I might as well apply right now, since big companies fill up new grad roles pretty fast, so I did. I filled out the application, attached my resume. My personal website was going through a revision, but I still put the link up. But surprisingly, Google replied very soon with two coding questions. I finished them just in time. A week or two later, I received a call from a recruiter, scheduling for a phone screen. Wow, I couldn't believe I was on the starting line of a Google's interview. The phone interview went pretty smooth as well. After the interview, I had to go to China for a month. That was the end of last semester. During the winter break, I received the call from my recruiter, he congradulated me for passing the phone interview. He said the interviewer gave me very good remark. This greatly boosted my confidence. Am I one of the lucky kids who are able to work at top tech companies right after college, I thought to my self. I told my family about the interview I was going through the second day. They were all crazy about that. They were talking if I ended up in Google, I could boost the Ads of their new massage salon (well, I'm sure that's beyond a software engineer's capability).

Google's interview encouraged me to start working on my interview skill. As most people, I also got a copy of the ["bible"](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=53D6E1Z76AFWV7Y0M496). During my time at China, I read through most of the questions in the book. For most of them, I was able to come up with an algorithm without refering to the hints or answers. When I came back from China and started the new semester, I was preparing for the Google on-site interview, while at the same time keeping an eye on other opportunities.

Finally, Google's on-site. I flew across the continent from New York to california. I was so excited after I got off the plane. Everything in California seems interesting to me. I took a bus from SFO airport to Palo Alto, where my hotel was. I arrived at the cozy little hotel at 10, went over some of the stuff in Crack the Coding Interview and went to bed early.

Google's interview was very long, I went over 4 interviews with a lunch in the middle. The questions were not hard. Actually I feel they are among the easier questions in Crack the Coding Interview. At my first interview, I was nervous. My brain frozed and I was having trouble figuring out a simple boolean expression in my code. I told my interviewer I was nervous. He smiled and said, same as everybody. The following interviews went pretty smooth as I could tell. But for two of them I didn't have enough time to solve some follow up questions.

Lunch is another informal interview, although my performance will not be taken into consideration during lunch. After the lunch, I asked my interviewer if he could take me to a tour around the Google campus. He agreed. It was really nice to see the different parts of Google campus. Some area has totally different architectural style than other places. Some buildings are more vibrant, some are more standard.

I felt I did the best in my last interview, the question was a little bit challenging comparing to others. It's a dynamic prigraming question involving depth first search. I was able to quickly spot the pattern and come up with an efficient algorithm. After the coding part, I talked a lot with my interviewer about the culture of Google, including the employee's relationship, coding practice, the [20 percent project](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/05/13/google-twenty-percent-time-diversity/27208475/) and so on. Overall, I felt the Google on-site interview was a really nice experience. At least they pay for everything, and the food was really nice (ever had squid from cafeteria?).

After I came back, I attended the IT and engineering career fair at my school. Not many companies came, the big ones were Facebook and Bloomberg. I talked to both of them. I felt, as a senior walking into a career fair was a totally different mentality. When we were freshmen or sophomores, we were like the poorly dressed halloween kids, begging adults to spare some candies. If we were lucky, we walked out with a bunch of nice stickers. But as senior, I felt every door was open to me.

Bloomberg reached out to me after the career fair for an On-Campus-Interview. I would be interviewed at the career center in my school. First Google, then Bloomberg, I felt I was on a fast track to career success.

Bloomberg's first interview wasn't very challenging either. I talked with two engineers from Bloomberg, each giving me a question to solve. I was not very clear about the requirement of the problems. They both seems very open-ended. I asked for clarification and requirement, but there wasn't much. The questions were meant to evaluate my own interpretation and implemetation.

Things can't always be what I want, can they? A week after Bloomberg's interview, I received rejection from it. The next day, Google's rejection also came.

Suddenly I'm at the starting point again.

To be continued.
